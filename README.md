# Ray Tracer in C++ from Scratch

This project is a graphics rendering coursework where I implemented a raytracer from scratch in C++ (Mark 92/100). The raytracer generates realistic 3D images by simulating the behaviour of light rays as they interact with objects in a scene. The program outputs ppm images, which can be viewed in various photo editors and using code editor extensions. I really enjoyed working on this!
